# the pgpool postgres proxy and load balancer

This chart uses the [PGPool-II](https://pgpool.net) and an enormous amount of
too-clever-by-half scripting to provide automatic load balancing across a
Google CloudSQL Postgres database and one or more read replicas in the same
region.

The primary moving parts are:

- [PGPool](https://pgpool.net) itself.  This runs in the pod's primary container, launched
  from the [pgpool.sh](bin/pgpool.sh) wrapper script

- A [discovery](bin/discovery.sh) script that runs in a separate container.  Once a minute, this script:
     - Uses the `gcloud` cli to list any primary dbs that match the `PRIMARY_INSTANCE_PREFIX` env
       variable as a prefix. (i.e. a prefix of `metadata-` matches `metadata-4093504851`)
     - Lists all currently active read replicas of the primary database
     - Uses the [envtpl](https://github.com/odenio/envtpl) tool to fill out [pgpool.conf.tmpl](conf/pgpool.conf.tmpl)
       and copy the result into `/etc/pgpool/pgpool.conf` if it differs from what is already there.
     - If replicas have been added or removed, it runs [pcp_reload_config](https://www.pgpool.net/docs/42/en/html/pcp-reload-config.html)
       which forces the pgpool process to re-read its configuration file.
     - If replicas have been added, it runs [pcp_attach_node](https://www.pgpool.net/docs/42/en/html/pcp-attach-node.html)
       to tell pgpool to begin routing traffic to it

- The [pgpool prometheus exporter](https://github.com/pgpool/pgpool2_exporter), which
  exposes a Prometheus-compatible `/metrics` HTTP endpoint with statistics gleaned
  from PGPool's [internal stats commands](https://www.pgpool.net/docs/42/en/html/sql-commands.html).

- The [telegraf](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf) monitoring agent,
  configured to forward the metrics exposed by the exporter to Google Cloud
  Monitoring, formerly known as Stackdriver.

In general you should expect that if you add a new replica, it should start
taking 1/Nth of the select query load (where N is the number of replicas)
within 5 to 15 minutes (beware of stackdriver reporting lag!).

By default as we've configured it, pgpool will send all mutating statements
(UPDATE/INSERT/DELETE and all statements including SELECT inside a transaction
with a mutating statement) to the primary instance, and load balance (on a
per-statement level) all SELECTs evenly across the available read replicas.

The exception is that any statement containing the string `DO NOT LOAD BALANCE`
(inside a comment is okay and in fact expected) will be routed to the primary
instance no matter what.  This is configureable at deploy time as
`.pgpool.primaryRoutingQueryPatternList` in [values.yaml](Helm/values.yaml).

# background info: maybe the real friends were all the yaks we shaved along the way

A billion fussy details stood in between us and the simple-seeming state of
affairs described above, and it's possible you may have to debug them in anger,
so here are a few of them:

## inter-container authentication

The updater container uses the [pcp cli
commands](https://www.pgpool.net/docs/42/en/html/pcp-commands.html) to talk to
pgpool over its tcp control port (9898/tcp).  The PCP protocol requires
password auth; this is set up in the [pcp.conf](conf/pcp.conf) file that is in
the shared volume mounted as `/etc/pgpool` in both containers.  A random PCP
password is set up at runtime if you do not set `.pcp.password` in
`values.yaml`.

If you need to run any of the `pcp_*` commands yourself for interactive
debugging, you will need to use the `-h localhost -w` flags.  The `-w` flag
forces the commands to use the `/root/.pcppass` file as the auth source so that
the updater script (and you) can issue pcp commands without typing the
password.

Note: the `pcp.conf` file is generated at runtime from the
[template](conf/pcp.conf.tmpl).

## config reloads don't do what you think

Adding a new replica to `pgpool.conf` and running
[pcp_reload_config](https://www.pgpool.net/docs/42/en/html/pcp-reload-config.html)
does not commence sending traffic to that node!  It only makes pgpool aware
that the node _exists_ -- you have to then run the
[pcp_attach_node](https://www.pgpool.net/docs/42/en/html/pcp-attach-node.html)
command to tell pgpool that the node is able to receive traffic.  The discovery
script does this for you automatically.

## node ID to hostname/ip bindings must be stable

Pgpool gets extremely unhappy if the hostname or IP address of a node changes
out from underneath it; we've addressed this by adding an [extremely
sleazy](bin/functions.sh) persistence model: for every IP address we observe,
we create a new node ID, and node IDs are never recycled for the lifetime of
the pod.

The pgpool documentation is silent on the question of how many backend nodes it
is capable of monitoring: if you delete and then re-create a large number of
replicas for some reason, it might be advisable to slowly roll the pgpool pods
to make sure they start from scratch.

## Oh god, Stackdriver

Getting useful stackdriver metrics out of pgpool was easily 60% of the process
of pulling this project together.  By default, the _only_ statistics interface
that pgpool offers is a series of ["SQL-like"
commands](https://www.pgpool.net/docs/42/en/html/sql-commands.html) that are
run inside a psql session.  Importantly, the tables returned by these commands
are not actual tables and cannot be queried with SELECT or JOIN.  (You can add
the ability to do that with the [pgpool_adm
extension](https://www.pgpool.net/docs/42/en/html/pgpool-adm.html) but of
course there is no way to install that on a CloudSQL instance.)

But there was some good news: the
[pgpool2_exporter](https://github.com/pgpool/pgpool2_exporter) is a standalone
binary that scrapes and parses the data returned by the "sql-like" commands and
exports it as a prometheus-compatible `/metrics` endpoint.

The bad news is that it has several critical bugs in it; at the time of this
writing we have two pull requests awaiting evaluation upstream:

- [Counter types were exported as gauges](https://github.com/pgpool/pgpool2_exporter/pull/10)
- [No metric for ratio of available connections](https://github.com/pgpool/pgpool2_exporter/pull/9)

We are currently running a build of the exporter that has our fixes
pre-applied; you can see this in the [Dockerfile](Dockerfile).

## Oh god, Telegraf

Having cobbled together a prometheus-like metrics endpoint, the obvious last
step was to use [telegraf](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf) to forward
the data to Stackdriver.

Unfortunately, when we did so, we immediately noticed something very strange:
any counter- type metric, no matter what values telegraf appeared to be
sending, produced a graph that was a flat line at some seemingly random value
between 0 and 1, and manual queries for the timeseries data from the
stackdriver API would at first return data and then after a few minutes return
only `{"unit": "not_a_unit"}` for the exact same query.

The issue turned out to be that the telegraf stackdriver output plugin (which
we here at oden wrote) was not actually setting the start time correctly on
CUMULATIVE stackdriver metrics, and the stackdriver API imposes some frankly
odd conditions on same.

We have [an open PR](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/pull/10097) against
telegraf that fixes this behavior, and for now we are deploying a version of
telegraf helpfully provided by influxdata as part of their PR review process.
(This, also, is in the dockerfile.)

Lastly, it's worth calling out the [telegraf config
file](Helm/templates/configmap.yaml); in order to correctly fill in the
required attributes of a stackdriver `gke_container` resource, we run telegraf
under a [wrapper script](bin/telegraf.sh) that queries the GCP instance
metadata API in order to fill out the relevant environment variables.
